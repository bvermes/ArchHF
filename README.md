# Project Overview
This was a school project I did at the first semester of my master studies. The goal of this project was to make an application using machine learning.
I choose to create an app that is able to predict the breed of the dogs, using the phones camera. This uses a pretty easy tensorflow lite model integrated into a mobile application. 
The training data is from kaggle and I cleaned them using python, to remove the pictures, that are incorrect or using formats, that tensorflow is not able to work with. 


# Skills learned
In the past I've used tensorflow for image recognition, so this was more like practice, but it was useful, to learn a few tricks in terms of data cleaning/selection.
The mobile app part of the project was also a bit of a practice, but it helped me understand deeper, 
how can the different kotlin components communicate and how should we pay attention to the OOP principles while developing a mobile app.
